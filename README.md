# Yammerfix, a Greasemonkey script that fixes Yammer's UI

Though I really do like Yammer, over the years, it has just added useless
feature after useless feature, and it is now a bloated mess in the web client.
This greasemonkey script stops the madness by hiding useless functionality
like: groups, activity stream, and the ugly, space-wasting 3rd column.

It also makes the main content area wider and cleans up the left-hand
navigation. It relocates the "Online Now" avatars to the left side,
auto-expands the links, and removes useless links like Org Chart and Pages.
